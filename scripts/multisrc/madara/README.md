or you can check the version by adding "/wp-content/themes/madara/style.css"
to the site url and check the version in the file

## Add a new source

### sources.json

To add a new source you need to add it to sources.json:

- id: the id of the source (something unique)
- sourceName: the name of the source (you can use the value of "name" in "https://site.com/wp-json/" if it exists)
- sourceSite: the site url
- options: the options of the source
  - lang: the language of the source (default: "English") (check that the language
   exists in the languages (check folder names in "plugins/"))
  - useNewChapterEndpoint: if the source uses the new chapter endpoint
  - versionIncrements: needs to be updated everytime the site url is updated
  - customJS: custom javascript that will be excuted when getting the text (if
   the site has a custom copyright that need to be removed)

### icon

To add an icon to the source you can just run `npm run icons` to generate all icons (make sure `npm run generate` works on your machine)

Or you can manualy find the icon of the site \
(try the favicon of the site (https://site.com/favicon.ico) most of the times it redirects you to an image named something like "cropped-site-32x32.png" try to access "cropped-site.png" or "site.png" if that did not work you can try to access "https://site.com/wp-json/" at the end of this very long file there should be a "site_icon_url" value
) (don't forget to convert it to png)
and add it to the folder "public/static/multisrc/madara/{sourceID}/icon.png"

### filters

To add filters to a source you need to run the script "get_filters.js" \
(`npx node scripts/multisrc/madara/get_filters.js`
(if you are at the root of the project) (and you have ran "npm install" before))
and follow the instructions (url is easier and faster but sometimes it doesn't work)
